Tracking Spread of Poison Ivy along the Appalachian Trail

Project description: Develop an Android application that will facilitate various types of data collection along the Poison Ivy AT Mega Transect. This application will collect data about the types of poison ivy and gps coordinates, as well as providing data organization through a MySQL database. The idea is to simplify the data collection of the most frequent data  to minimize handling the cell phoneâ€™s battery usage.

Expected impact of the project: Provide hikers with a simple and effective way of recording data along the AT and enabling them to upload it when internet connection becomes available. 

Required skills of the team engaging in the project: Android development, MySQL, and hardware skills
