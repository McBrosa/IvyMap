This application will collect data about the types of poison ivy and gps coordinates, as well as providing data organization through a MySQL database. The idea is to simplify the data collection of the most frequent data  to minimize handling the cell phoneâ€™s battery usage.

Project deliverables: Android application and codeable buttons connecting to phone.

Expected impact of the project: Provide hikers with a simple and effective way of recording data along the AT and enabling them to upload it when internet connection becomes available. 

Required skills of the team engaging in the project: Android development, MySQL, and hardware skills
